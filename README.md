## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Clerk account
- Supabase project

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone <your-repo>
cd party-couple-game
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Fill in your environment variables:

```env
# Clerk (get from dashboard.clerk.com)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...

# Supabase (get from supabase.com/dashboard)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key

# App URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Database Setup

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Run the migration in `sql/001_init.sql` in the SQL editor
3. Seed the database:

```bash
npm run seed
```

### 4. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000`

## Architecture

### Authentication Flow

1. Public routes: `/`, `/sign-in`, `/sign-up`
2. Protected routes: All game modes require authentication
3. User profiles created automatically on first sign-in

### Database Schema

- **profiles**: User information (maps to Clerk userId)
- **rooms**: Game sessions for multiplayer
- **room_players**: Players in each room
- **rounds**: Game rounds with payload data
- **scores**: Player scores per room
- **cards**: Truth/dare and drinking game content
- **trivia_questions**: Quiz questions and answers

### Game Logic

- **Deterministic Spinner**: Uses seeded RNG (`lib/rng.ts`) for consistent results across clients
- **Server Actions**: All database writes go through Next.js server actions with Clerk auth
- **Real-time**: Supabase channels for live multiplayer updates

## Game Modes

### Couple Mode (Local Play)
- Intensity selection: PG, Romantic, Spicy
- Truth or Dare with scoring system
- Streak bonuses and skip penalties

### Party Mode (Multiplayer)
- Room-based with host authority
- Spinner selects active player
- Drinking challenges and party games

### Trivia Mode
- Multiple categories and difficulties
- Timer-based with speed bonuses
- Individual and team modes

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

2. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. Deploy!

The app is optimized for:
- HTTPS (required for PWA)
- Mobile responsiveness
